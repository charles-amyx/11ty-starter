[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and

## Code Quality

By default `CSS` and `JavaScript` is getting linted with every commit.

You can lint manually by running `npm run lint` and if errors occur you can try to fix them automatically by running `npm run format`.

With every pull request, the code is checked to if the site can be built without errors and afterwards `CSS` and `JavaScript` is getting linted.

Additionally each page is audited by Lighthouse which can take some time. You can find the performance budget for this audit in the file `./budget.json`.
