        Set out for a great adventure

        He scratched our names out of all his letters
        Our mother shoulda just named you Laika"

        Its ribs are ceiling beams
        Its guts are carpeting
        I guess we have some time to kill"

        And another comes on.
        Another one rides the bus-ah.
        Hey!
        He's gonna sit by you.
        Another one rides the bus."

Broken clouds thin away. Come again in a rush, they swell purple cliffs black, harry white birds into distances radiant. And soon dampen autumn-sun shadow, clatter ancient rain across a cold river. Below our brushwood gate, at the mill: hulled plain-rice, half-wet and fragrant.

This treasure was discovered in a bamboo thicket &mdash;
I washed the bowl in a spring and then mended it.
After morning meditation, I take my gruel in it;
At night, it serves me soup or rice.
Cracked, worn, weather-beaten, and misshapen
But still of noble stock!
