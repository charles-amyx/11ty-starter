    <p>
    Barnacles (balanus glandula) are sticky little crustaceans related to crabs, lobsters, and shrimps. Those aren't dragon claws—they're gooseneck barnacles! These filter feeders are found in the rocky tide pools of Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary.
    </p><p>Of the more than 1,400 species of barnacles found in the world’s waterways, the most common ones are called acorn barnacles. As anyone who’s ever maintained a vessel knows, removing barnacles requires some elbow grease (or a pressure washer). That's why some boaters call them by their slang name: "crusty foulers." </p>

Broken clouds thin away. Come again in a rush, they swell purple cliffs black, harry white birds into distances radiant. And soon dampen autumn-sun shadow, clatter ancient rain across a cold river. Below our brushwood gate, at the mill: hulled plain-rice, half-wet and fragrant.

This treasure was discovered in a bamboo thicket &mdash;
I washed the bowl in a spring and then mended it.
After morning meditation, I take my gruel in it;
At night, it serves me soup or rice.
Cracked, worn, weather-beaten, and misshapen
But still of noble stock!
