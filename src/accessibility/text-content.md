## Structure

### Subheadings and hierarchy

Use the style dropdown in the text editor to assign heading levels. This helps keep look and feel consistent throughout the site. Use subheadings to create landmarks on your page. Think about what a user would learn if they only read the headings and subheadings.

-   The Page title will automatically be a Heading1

-   Assign Heading2, Heading3, paragraph, etc. formats to reflect the hierarchy and relationships of information.

-   Use headings to reflect structure. Don't skip heading levels, and DO NOT use headings just to affect the design.

### Groupings

Look for ways to place related information together

-   Smaller chunks are easier to take in, and grouping them physically together reinforces the idea that they're related.

### Scannability

Good web content tells users at a glance whether or not they've arrived at the right place, and helps them do what they need to do.

-   Be concise - If you can say it in fewer words, do so. One idea per paragraph.

-   Put the most important information first - Users, and search engines, scan to find the information they need and move on.

-   Avoid acronyms - They're confusing and/or meaningless to outside users. If you must use an acronym on the page, be sure to use its full name on first reference and include the acronym in parentheses. ie. Master of Science in Nursing (MSN).

### Lists

Where you see commas, ask yourself if it could be a list

-   Use bulleted lists most of the time

-   Only use numbered lists if the order of the list items is important (if they're ranked or sequential)

### Statistics

When you see a statistic, ask yourself if it could be a graphic or chart

-   Try a big number and a small amount of text

-   Focus on the number and impact, provide a link to the data

## Voice, Tone and Grammar

### Edit mercilessly

1.  Cut out procedural language like "this page explains..." Do this first. It'll give you less copy to have to edit.

2.  Make the language conversational (important even for smart people). See Hemingway Editor link above. Even though we're a university, you want content that's written at about a tenth-grade level.

3.  Rearrange wording to make verbs active and sentence structure simple. Sometimes it helps to find instances of is, are, & were and ask yourself what action is really taking place.

### Write meaningful link text

The text your visitor clicks to follow a link should tell them where they're going. ie.[  The Guardian ,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) NOT [click here](https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/noClickHere) or learn more.

### Central Source of Truth

Avoid posting duplicate information. It quickly becomes difficult to keep up to date. If information already exists on a more central source (ie. the Rackham site for info common to all grad students) link to that page instead of repeating information on your site.

## Style

-   This is Title Case

-   This is sentence case

-   DON'T USE ALL CAPS IN BODY TEXT

-   fOr ThE LoVE OF suGar, don't use mixed caps in text. Ever. Unless you're giving an example on why you shouldn't, then it's okay.

-   Limit your use of exclamation points!!!!!!

## Navigation Menus

Menus should be organized according to what site visitors need, not according to department organization or preferences.

Navigation labels should be brief (1 or 2 words), familiar and different from one another.

-   Avoid jargon and internal language -- Resist the urge to use the names of offices or programs in navigation menus

-   Stick with commonly understood terms (ie. Home, Contact, About)

-   Remove repeated words (i.e. Resources, Information, Michigan, Nursing)

-   Remove excessive identifiers (i.e. Department Contacts rather than Graduate Nursing Department Contact List)

-   Ask yourself "What will people expect to do/find/learn about if they follow this link?"

Items in the navigation menus should NOT lead to a site with a different navigation.

This disorients users and causes them to distrust your site. This is especially true for main navigation.

-   Create a landing page related to a topical grouping and link to external pages from there.

-   Use a Related Links element to link to external sites and indicate to users that they're leaving the site.

-   But what about too many clicks? The old "3-click rule" has been [widely debunked](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/3-click-rule/). It's more important to provide users with a clear sense that they're moving toward their goal than it is to minimize their number of clicks.
