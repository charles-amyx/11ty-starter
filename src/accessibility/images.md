# Images

## Resources

-   [W3C Guide to making media accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/)

-   [Image description guidelines](http://diagramcenter.org/table-of-contents-2.html#toc) (including graphs, diagrams and maps)

-   [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) (image compression tool)

### Alternative text (alt text)

Alt text is invisible to sighted users, but screen readers google web crawlers read it and glean understanding of what role the pictures play on your page.

Context matters. There's a lot of subtlety in alt text. Your alt text may change depending on how you're using a photo.

-   [WebAIM Alt Text techniques](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/) offers a good guide

-   [Another good article on writing alt text](https://jakearchibald.com/2021/great-alt-text/)

-   Use a short, descriptive phrase - visually impaired site visitors should be able to visualize the image from the description

-   Avoid unnecessary words (i.e. "This is a picture of....") and redundancy. Phrase does not need to be a complete sentence

### Web-friendly filename

This makes images easier to search for in your media library, more meaningful to search engines and screen readers

-   Create and stick to an image file naming convention

-   Use relevant keywords in the file name.

-   Keep it short.

-   Words should be lowercase and separated by dashes.

-   DON'T use special characters (ƒ, #, ™, etc.) or spaces.
