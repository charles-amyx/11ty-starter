# Accessibility

## Let's do the right thing!

Making sure all users can access the information and services we provide is the right thing to do, as well as our legal responsibility under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

-   [Section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov/)

-   [ADA.gov](https://www.ada.gov/)

-   [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/). (U-M websites are held to the WCAG 2.0AA standard)

### Captioning and Descriptions

There are lots of tools to help you generate "text alternatives" for visual content. These help bring deliver the information presented in graphics, videos, etc. to people who have visual impairments. Here are a few specialty tools. They've gotten positive feedback from the U-M accessibility community but are untested at this time.

Captioning: [Web Captioner](https://webcaptioner.com) works with Chrome browser.

[Relational Diagram guidelines:](http://diagramcenter.org/specific-guidelines-d.html#44) Guidelines for creating description files for various relational diagrams, including flow charts, hierarchies, venn diagrams, and cycles.

### Alternative (Alt) text

One size does not fit all. Make sure your alt text provides context for the image it's describing This[  article on the need for context in alt text](https://uxdesign.cc/context-is-the-most-critical-aspect-of-alt-text-everyone-seems-to-miss-e18803a79212) sums it up well.

### Screen Readers

-   [TalkBack cheat sheet](http://pauljadam.com/demos/talkbackcheatsheet.html) (Android)

### Global Accessibility Checkers

Automated tools can't detect every accessibility issue, but they're a great place to start.

-   [WAVE Accessibility Tool](http://wave.webaim.org/) (website, also available as a Chrome and Firefox browser extension)

-   [aXe](https://www.deque.com/product/axe/) ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?utm_campaign=aXe%20The%20Accessibility%20Engine&utm_content=aXe%20for%20Chrome&utm_medium=Hyperlink&utm_source=Website),[  Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/axe-devtools/?src=search&utm_campaign=aXe%20The%20Accessibility%20Engine&utm_content=aXe%20for%20Firefox&utm_medium=Hyperlink&utm_source=Website)) https://www.deque.com/product/axe/

### Simulators

-   [NoCoffee](https://accessgarage.wordpress.com/2013/02/09/458/) (Chrome) color blindness and low vision simulator

### Color Contrast Checkers

-   [Color Safe](http://colorsafe.co/) (great for selecting accessible color palettes)

-   [WebAIM color contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) (accounts for differences in font size.)

-   [University of Michigan Brand color palette contrast chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15YoKPYgPc2BUb6cpQztvwXRBsygpX4ikffnYB1UvhY4/edit?usp=sharing)
